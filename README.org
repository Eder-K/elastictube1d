elastictube1d preCICE fluid-structure coupling example

* Compilation
** Environment variables
*** PRECICE_ROOT
points to the precice source directory, usually the root of the git checkout.
** Compile by executing scons
* Execution
1) Create a directory called output inside your working directory
2) Start the two solvers, preferably in two seperate shells for output monitoring
   ./StructureSolver precice_config_for_1D_solvers N
   ./FluidSolver precice_config_for_1D_solvers N tau kappa
   Use the same directory to start from, otherwise the solvers won't find the sockets for communication.
* Parameters
** N
Number of mesh elements, needs to be equal for fluid and structure solver
** tau
The dimensionless time step size.
tau = u0 * Delta t / L
Try tau = 0.01..0.1 as starting value.
** kappa
Dimensionless structural stiffness:
kappa = sqrt( (E*h)/(2*rho*r0-p0/2) )
Try kappa = 10..100 as starting value.

A set of values that is known to converge: N=100, tau=0.1, kappa=10
